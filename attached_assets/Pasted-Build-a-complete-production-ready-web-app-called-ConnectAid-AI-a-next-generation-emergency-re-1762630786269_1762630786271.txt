Build a complete, production-ready web app called **ConnectAid AI** — a next-generation emergency response platform that uses Google Gemini, Maps, and AI voice to connect people in distress with real responders in real time.

⚙️ Requirements:
- **Frontend Framework:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) + Google Gemini API integration.
- **Database:** None required for now — simulate local user DB with localStorage.
- **AI Integration:** Use Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (text & grounding) for understanding and Google Maps API for real-world responder lookup.
- **Voice System:** Add speech recognition and AI text-to-speech using Gemini multimodal or Web Speech API.
- **Real-World Data:** Integrate Google Maps API & Places API to pull live responders (hospitals, police, shelters) based on user coordinates.

🧩 Core Pages:
1. **Landing Page**
   - Cinematic animated background (Framer Motion + video overlay)
   - Central “Get Help” button
   - Soft glow particle effects and adaptive color schemes (red for medical, blue for police, green for mental health)

2. **Emergency Flow**
   - User can speak or type emergency details
   - AI detects language, simplifies, translates to English internally
   - Calls Gemini model for emergency categorization
   - Displays nearest responders (from Google Maps API)
   - AI gives real-time voice feedback (“I’ve found the nearest hospital, connecting now…”)

3. **Profile Page**
   - User details: name, contact, emergency contacts
   - History of previous alerts stored locally (localStorage or mock DB)

4. **Control Panel (for responders/admins)**
   - Dashboard showing active alerts (simulated)
   - Filter by type: medical, disaster, legal, etc.
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket simulation

🌍 Integrations:
- **Google Gemini API:** for natural language understanding, translation, and voice generation.
- **Google Maps API:** to locate and rank nearby emergency responders.
- **Web Speech API:** for real-time voice input and spoken feedback.
- **Geolocation API:** auto-detect user’s coordinates.

🎨 Animation & Design:
- Background should have a **cinematic gradient animation**, blending colors softly (e.g., deep blue → crimson → amber).
- Use **Framer Motion** for page transitions and button micro-animations.
- Smooth fade, parallax motion on scroll, and ambient glow particle effects.
- Minimalist, high-contrast UI optimized for accessibility under stress.

🗣 Voice Assistant Features:
- Activate by saying “Hey ConnectAid.”
- Convert user voice to structured text.
- AI analyzes message with Gemini and speaks back using Gemini TTS or Web Speech API.
- Voice playback includes ambient sound fade during responses for realism.

📦 Tech Stack Summary:
