Core Functionalities:
1. **Real-World Nearby Results**
   - Use **Google Maps Places API** or **Grounding Tools** to fetch *real-time nearby emergency responders*.
   - Location should be determined automatically from browser geolocation (navigator.geolocation).
   - Query example:
     ```
     Find hospitals, police stations, and fire stations within 20 km of latitude={user.lat}, longitude={user.lng} in India only.
     Return verified institutions, prioritize .gov, .org, and NABH-accredited hospitals.
     ```
   - If the model uses Gemini grounding, include `locationBias: "IP_BIAS"` and `radiusMeters: 20000`.

2. **Localized AI Voice Output**
   - Replace default TTS with an **Indian human-like voice**, such as:
     - “Neerja” or “Aditi” for Indian English
     - “Sangeeta” for Hindi
   - Use natural pauses, empathy, and warmth.
   - Example: “I understand. Help is on the way. Please stay calm and move to a safe area.”

3. **User Interface Design**
   - Cinematic, smooth interface (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion).
   - Add animated background matching emergency type:
     - Medical → soft red pulse
     - Police → deep blue glow
     - Fire → orange gradient waves
     - Mental Health → calm teal light
   - Include a large central “Get Help” button with glowing pulse animation.
   - When AI speaks, display waveform animation synchronized with voice.

4. **AI Behavior**
   - Detect user language automatically (Hindi, English, Tamil, etc.)
   - Translate user input to English internally.
   - Categorize the emergency correctly (Medical, Fire, Legal, etc.)
   - Fetch **only local results within India**, using Google Maps/Places or OpenStreetMap APIs.
   - Provide real-time distance and name of the nearest help center in kilometers, not miles.

5. **Speech Interaction**
   - Use **Web Speech Recognition API** for input.
   - Use **Google TTS or ElevenLabs India Voice** for output with warm tone.
   - Example configuration:
     ```
     speechConfig: {
       voice: "en-IN-NeerjaNeural",
       style: "calm",
       pitch: 1.0,
       rate: 0.95
     }
     ```

6. **Response Flow**
   - “Hey ConnectAid” activates the AI assistant.
   - AI listens → detects intent → fetches nearest responders → gives verbal + visual guidance.
   - Example:
     - User: “Someone fainted near me.”
     - AI: “It sounds like a medical emergency. The nearest hospital is 2.3 kilometers away at Fortis Mumbai. Would you like me to call them?”

7. **Accuracy Layer**
   - Prioritize India-specific data sources (Google Maps India, NDMA, local police databases).
   - If location fails, ask: “Can you please share your city or PIN code?”

8. **Tech Stack**
   - Frontend: React + Tailwind + Framer Motion
   - AI: Google Gemini API (with proper geolocation grounding)
   - Voice: Web Speech API + Indian TTS (Google, Azure, or ElevenLabs)
   - Maps: Google Maps API / Places API (region=IN)
   - Backend (optional): Node.js + Express for proxying requests

🎯 Expected Output:
A web-based emergency AI assistant that:
- Detects the user’s location in India
- Lists nearby real responders (within 20 km)
- Responds in soothing, Indian-accented voice
- Speaks empathetically and reacts visually
- Never shows irrelevant international data
